### **Use Case:**

Consider a wind farm, where hundreds of wind turbines are harnessing energy from wind and storing them as energy in large cells. All these big equipments are located in remote offshore and often requires engineers to travel long distance to troubleshoot them.

Leveraging IoT, Machine level data processing and streaming can save a lot to the industry.
